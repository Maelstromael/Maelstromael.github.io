The homework was not really hard but I just needed to refresh my knowledge of css and html.

Even though I was able to layout the page as requested, I am afraid that it was too hard-coded and we know that hard coding is not really good.
The page may not be responsive if the size of the screen changes and that was my main problem.
I am still looking for ways to fix it, without having to complicated codes.
